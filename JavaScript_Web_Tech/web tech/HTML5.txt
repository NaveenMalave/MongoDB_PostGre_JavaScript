why HTML5?
-new form elements

=======================css=============
cascading style sheet-
--html has limited attributes for styling and extensive style and decorations if it is needed CSS
can be used. it also separates the content from the styling which makes easier in maintaining the web pages in
future.
More sharing and reusability of the style are achived using CSS.
Three ways to use css in ur page.
1) inline CSS: it is private to an html element by using an attribute "style"
e.g 
<p style="color:red; background-color:yellow"> para1</p>
<p>para2 </style>

2) Embedded CSS: it is defined in <style>tag under <head> element and it is meant for the 
whole page for that type of element
syntax=>
 <style>
p{
color:red;
}
</style>
</head>

3)external css" it is defined in a separate css file and whenever it is needed, it is linked the page
using <link href="file.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/> This link is to be defined under the 
<head>tag
file.css:-
	p{
  color:red;
}
4) css class:  it is defined using dot() with some name. it has got more sharing as it is
independent of type element which can use it. i.e it can be used by any elements.
syntax:>
 .c1{
 color:red;
}
use: 
<p class="c1 c2"> hello</p>

CSS Selector: to refer and select elements of the page to apply the style.
a) element selector:
  h1{ color: red;}
b) attribute selector:
input["name"]{
color:red;
}
c) class selector:
  ul.xli { color:red;}
d)id selector:
ul#x li{color:red;}
